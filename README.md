## **Dataset Description**
This project leverages a dataset collected through an online survey conducted by Kulture Hire Administrators to delve into the career aspirations of Gen Z in India. By analyzing the survey data, we aim to understand the key factors influencing Gen Z's career choices, their preferences for work-life balance and company culture, and the gap between their expectations and traditional employer offerings.


## **Objective**
The Primary Objective of this project is to understand the career aspirations of Gen Z in India, identify the key factors influencing their career choices, and explore the gap between Gen Z's expectations and traditional employer offerings.


## **Work Flow**
1. The 5W1H analysis in MS Word provides a comprehensive overview of the career aspirations of Gen Z and the challenges faced by employers in meeting their expectations. It covers the key stakeholders (Gen Z and employers), the core issues (mismatch between aspirations and opportunities), the timeline of relevant events, the underlying reasons for the disconnect, and potential solutions for both Gen Z and employers.

The analysis identifies key trends such as Gen Z's focus on meaningful work, their preference for flexible work arrangements, and their high expectations for career growth. It also highlights the need for employers to adopt more modern HR practices and create a more engaging work environment to attract and retain Gen Z talent.


2. The stakeholder analysis report in MS word identifies key stakeholders involved in the career aspirations of Gen Z and analyzes their roles, interests, and influence in addressing the gap between Gen Z's expectations and traditional employer offerings.

The report highlights the importance of understanding Gen Z's values and priorities for employers and HR professionals. It also emphasizes the role of educational institutions, career counselors, and technology platforms in bridging the gap and creating a more favorable work environment for Gen Z.

By aligning with Gen Z's expectations, employers can improve talent acquisition and retention, foster a positive work culture, and create a more meaningful work experience for their employees.
